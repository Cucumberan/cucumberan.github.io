# Dashboard 3 - Product Metrics Analysis

## Business Objective

Over the past few days, two significant events have impacted user engagement:  

1. **A large-scale marketing campaign** brought an influx of new users to the application.  
2. **A sudden drop in daily active users (DAU)** was observed on a particular day.  

To better understand these events, we developed a dashboard focused on analyzing key product metrics.  

## Key Questions Addressed  

- **User Retention Analysis**: What happened to the users acquired through the marketing campaign? How frequently do they continue using the application after their first visit?

- **Drop in User Engagement**: What segment of users failed to engage with the product? Are there common characteristics among them (e.g., device type, registration source, geographic location)?

## Insights and Decision-Making  

By visualizing product usage trends and retention patterns, this dashboard helps the business:  

- Evaluate the effectiveness of the marketing campaign and the long-term engagement of acquired users.  
- Identify potential product issues or external factors contributing to the DAU drop.  
- Develop targeted strategies to improve user retention and engagement.  


# 4. Weekly Active Audience Chart 

This chart visualizes the composition of the active user base over time, segmented into three key groups:  

- **New Users** – first-time activity in the news feed during the given week.  
- **Returning Users** – active both in the current and the previous week.  
- **Churned Users** – were active last week but did not engage this week.  

By tracking these segments weekly, the dashboard helps identify trends in user retention, acquisition, and churn.
